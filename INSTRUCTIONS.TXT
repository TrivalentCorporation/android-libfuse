Once you have downloaded this source package from Github, follow these build instructions.

Note - if you do not have Make installed, you must first install it.


1) Open <SOURCE_ROOT>/Makefile
2) Modify the PROJECT_ROOT_DIR variable to point to wherever you downloaded the source package into, ie. <SOURCE_ROOT>
3) Save the change above.
4) Download the Android NDK (Native Development Kit), version r10e or later. This is needed to use the Android ARM-eabi gcc compiler, and also reference Android's header files. 
5) Open <SOURCE_ROOT>/src/Makefile
6) Modify the PROJECT_ROOT_DIR variable to point to wherever you downloaded the source package into, ie. <SOURCE_ROOT>
7) Modify the ANDROID_NDK_HOME variable to point to whatever you downloaded the Android NDK.
8) The original author of these instructions compiled on a 64-bit Linux machine. If you are on a 64-bit Linux machine, you do not need to make further changes.
9) If not, you will need to further modify the CC, CPP, and STRIP variables to point to the NDK toolchain specific to your machine.


Finally, run "make clean" and then "make" in either <SOURCE_ROOT> or <SOURCE_ROOT>/src.
If those commands run without error, you should see a bunch of object files (.o files) in <SOURCE_ROOT>/src, as well as the final libfuse.so.

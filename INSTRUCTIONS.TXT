Note - if you do not have Make installed, you must first install it.


1) Open <SOURCE_ROOT>/Makefile
2) Modify the PROJECT_ROOT_DIR variable to point to wherever you downloaded the source package into, ie. <SOURCE_ROOT>
3) Save the change above.
4) Download the Android NDK (Native Development Kit), version r10e or later. This is needed to use the Android ARM-eabi gcc compiler, and also reference Android's header files. 
5) Open <SOURCE_ROOT>/src/Makefile
6) Modify the PROJECT_ROOT_DIR variable to point to wherever you downloaded the source package into, ie. <SOURCE_ROOT>
